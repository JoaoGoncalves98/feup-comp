If you believe this is an error, contact your class teacher.
=====================

High-priority:
	- Avoid storing large files (e.g., PDFs) in the git repository. DONE
	- Project has errors:
		- The ASTFunction class has no field named "secondName", which is used in yal2jvm.java. DONE
		- This issue is fixed by executing jjtree/javacc again but, if this is necessary, why include the generated Java files at all? DONE
	- Error messages with colors do not properly work on Windows: consider disabling colors on this platform.

Low-priority:
	- Use packages, instead of Java's default package
	- Stop after the first 10 parser errors
	- Consider rewriting the grammar to avoid use of LOOKAHEADs.
	- *.class should not be committed to the git repository. DONE
	- "(...|{})" would be more cleanly specified as "(...)?". DONE
