GLOBAL Grade of the project: 19


SUMMARY:
The goal of this project was to apply the knowledge acquired in the course unit Compilers by building a compiler for programs in the yal language. The compiler produces valid Java Virtual Machine (JVM) instructions to Jasmin, a tool to generate Java bytecodes given assembly programs with JVM instructions.
The main features of the tool we developed are:
- Syntactic error controller
- Semantic analysis
- Code generation


EXECUTE: (indicate how to run your tool)

 
DEALING WITH SYNTACTIC ERRORS: (Describe how the syntactic error recovery of your tool does work. Does it exit after the first error?) Afonso + Julieta

 
SEMANTIC ANALYSIS: (Refer the semantic rules implemented by your tool) Afonso

 
INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATIONS (IRs): (for example, when applicable, briefly describe the HLIR (high-level IR) and the LLIR (low-level IR) used, if your tool includes an LLIR with structure different from the HLIR)

 
CODE GENERATION: (when applicable, describe how the code generation of your tool works and identify the possible problems your tool has regarding code generation) Julieta

 
OVERVIEW: (refer the approach used in your tool, the main algorithms, the third-party tools and/or packages, etc.) Afonso


TESTSUITE AND TEST INFRASTRUCTURE: (Describe the content of your testsuite regarding the number of examples, the approach to automate the test, etc.) Julieta
 

TASK DISTRIBUTION:
Afonso Jorge Ramos: Dealing with syntactic errors, semantic analysis
Bárbara Sofia Silva: Code generation
Julieta Frade: Dealing with syntactic errors, Code generation


PROS: (Identify the most positive aspects of your tool) Afonso


CONS: (Identify the most negative aspects of your tool) Julieta
